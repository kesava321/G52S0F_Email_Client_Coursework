#Requirements For Email Client

###1.Document Introduction  
```  
This document will cover the requirements of an email client system. It will cover user and system requirements as well as functional and non-functional requirements. In addition to that UML diagrams will be used to support the email client system. 
 
 

```  
###2.System	Overview

```  
- A user can access the email client by using the web or the software.
- The user is then able to securely login into the system.
- Once logged in they can view any email they have received, send emails, delete      
  emails, forward emails and perform any other tasks usually found in any email client.  
- Additional security features are provided, such as being able to mark suspicious emails as spam or being able to an unverified block a sender. 
- The email client should also allow the secure transfer of any media files.
- The user must be able to add contacts to their address book. 
- Once the user has finished using the email client, they can then securely log out.

###3.Non-functional	requirements of	the	system
  
- Interface- The system should have an easy to use interface, that allows the user to easily perform any task they require.  
- Performance - Once an email is sent, it should arrive in the recipients mailbox within a few seconds. The email client must also be able to allocate the relevant memory, in order view big emails that contain a lot of data.
- Reliability - The email client should be able to send and receive emails without any errors or delays. 
- Availability - The client must be platform independent, i.e. it should work on windows, mac, line or any other operating system. 
- Security - The user account details and password should be encrypted and securely stored within the email client. 
- Maintainability- The email client should allow the user to maintain and manage all emails. Also the users profiles/account settings must be maintained, along with any software updates/security patches that may be released in the future. 
- Portability - The user should be able to access their email anywhere on any computer. 


 


###4.Functional requirements of	the	system

- Important emails can be flagged, so they appear at the top of the Inbox.
- Junk mail that does not require an immediate action, will be stored in the junk folder.
- Emails that may require attention at a later stage can be archived.
- Emails can also be organised into folders.
- When writing emails spell check should automatically recognise any incorrect spellings or grammatical errors. 
- The user must be able to attach a file to an email, by using the drag and drop interface or by manually selecting the file in the directory in which it is stored. 
- Users must be able to print emails.
- An auto-response feature may be added, in the event the user is on a vaccation and is unable to respond to an email. 
- The user must be able to view emails, send emails, delete emails and forward emails.
